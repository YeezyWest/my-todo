## Goal

Project Goal
The goal of this React Todo App project is to demonstrate my ability to build a functional web application using React. This project primary objectives are as follows:

- Create a User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add, update, and delete tasks.

- State Management with React: Showcase proficiency in state management with React by handling task data efficiently.

- Component Structure: Design and implement a well-structured component hierarchy to ensure code modularity and maintainability.

- Use of React Router: Integrate React Router to allow users to navigate between different views, such as a task list and task details.

- Data Persistence: Implement data persistence using local storage, allowing users to save and retrieve their tasks even after closing the browser.

- Responsiveness: Ensure the application is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to users in case of any issues.

- Testing: Write unit tests for critical components and functions to ensure the application's reliability.

- Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation in the README to guide reviewers through the project structure, installation, and usage.

## Tools used
